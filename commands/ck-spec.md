description: Create, amend, or backprop bug into SPEC.md. Sole mutator of spec.

# /ck-spec — spec mutator

Read `FORMAT.md` at repo root if not already loaded. Caveman rules apply.

## DISPATCH

Inspect `$ARGUMENTS` and project state:

1. No `SPEC.md` at repo root AND args describe idea → **NEW**
2. No `SPEC.md` AND `from-code` in args → **DISTILL**
3. `SPEC.md` exists AND args start `bug:` → **BACKPROP**
4. `SPEC.md` exists AND args start `amend` → **AMEND**
5. `SPEC.md` exists, no args → ask user which mode

## NEW — idea → spec

Input: user idea in args.

Steps:
1. Extract goal (1 line, caveman). → §G.
2. List constraints user stated or implied. → §C.
3. List external surfaces user named. → §I.
4. Propose initial invariants. → §V (numbered V1…).
5. Break goal into ordered tasks. → §T pipe table, status `.`, ids T1…
6. §B section with header row only (`id|date|cause|fix`).

Write `SPEC.md`. Show user full file. Ask: "spec OK? suggest edits or `/ck-build`."

## DISTILL — code → spec

Walk repo. Produce §G (infer from README/package.json/main entry), §C (infer from stack), §I (enumerate public APIs/CLIs/configs), §V (derive from tests and assertions), §T (one task per known TODO or missing test), §B (empty).

Caveman everywhere. Flag uncertain items with `?` so user can confirm.

## BACKPROP — bug → §B + §V

Input: `bug: <description>`.

1. Parse bug description.
2. Find root cause (read relevant code).
3. Decide: would new invariant catch recurrence? If yes → draft `V<next>`.
4. Append §B row: `B<next>|<date>|<cause>|V<N>`.
5. Append new invariant to §V.
6. If fix also changes behavior → add/update §T rows.
7. Show diff. Apply only on user OK.

Rule: every bug gets §B entry. Invariant optional but preferred.

## AMEND — targeted edit

Input: `amend §V.3` or `amend §T` etc.

Read that section. Show current. Ask user changes. Write. Show diff.

Never silently rewrite sections user did not name.

## OUTPUT RULES

- Caveman format per `FORMAT.md`.
- Preserve identifiers, paths, code verbatim.
- Numbering monotonic — never reuse §V.N or §B.N.
- §T row `cites` column ! list §V/§I deps: `T5|.|impl auth mw|V2,I.api`.

## NON-GOALS

- No sub-agents. Main thread writes.
- No dashboards, no logs, no state files beyond SPEC.md.
- No auto-build after /ck-spec. User invokes `/ck-build` explicitly.
